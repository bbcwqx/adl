# 00003 - Support Templates Folder

## Abstract

Being able to provide your own templates for the README and the ADRs can be
really useful. It allows you to customize this to your personal or team needs
while still sticking with the tool and processes for maintaining proper ADRs.

## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, there is no way to deviate from the existing templates for the README
and the ADRs. If you want to customize these, you will lose all changes upon
regen of the README. Effectively, if you do not agree with the templates that
are shipped with ADL, the tool may not be useful to you.

## Considered Options

### Do Nothing

These templates are minimal and other additions can be captured elsewhere.

### Support user-driven templates

Create a templates directory and allow users to specify templates to be used on
behalf of the CLI when generated READMEs and ADRs. Specify the fields via a
templating language that the CLI can replace.

## Decision Outcome

We are going to support user-driven templates via a templates folder in the ADR
directory. The templates folder should not be linked in the README contents. The
templates folder will also have it's own README with information on the
supported files that you can template, as well as the templating items that can
be replaced by the CLI such as timestamp or contents.
